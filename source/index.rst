Spatial Data Science with R and "terra"
=======================================

These resources teach spatial data analysis and modeling with *R*. *R* is a widely used programming language and software environment for data science. *R* also provides unparalleled opportunities for analyzing spatial data and for spatial modeling. 


If you have never used *R*, or if you need a refresher, you should start with our `Introduction to R <../intr/index.html>`__ 

 
.. topic:: 1. `Spatial data manipulation with R <spatial/index.html>`__

  | Read this to learn about the basics of reading, writing, and manipulating spatial data. (`pdf <spatial/Spatialdata.pdf>`__)
  | 

  
.. topic:: 2. `Spatial data analysis <analysis/index.html>`__

  | An introduction to methods for description, prediction and inference with spatial data. (`pdf <analysis/analysis.pdf>`__)
  |  

  
.. topic:: 3. `Remote sensing image analysis <rs/index.html>`__

  | Introduction to remote sensing (satellite) image analysis spatial data. (`pdf <rs/rs.pdf>`__)
  |


.. topic:: 4. `Processing MODIS data <modis/index.html>`__

  | Introduction to remote sensing (satellite) image analysis spatial data. (`pdf <modis/modis.pdf>`__)
  |


.. topic:: 5. `Case studies <cases/index.html>`__

   | A (small) collection of case studies that can help you learn more about particular topics and design your own workflows. (`pdf <cases/cases.pdf>`__)
   |
   

.. topic:: 6. `Species Distribution Modeling <sdm/index.html>`__

   | An tutorial for predicting the geographic ranges of species (under development). (`pdf <sdm/SDM.pdf>`__)
   |
  
  
   
Manuals
-------

.. topic:: I. `The terra package <pkg/index.html>`__

  | A detailed description of the methods in the terra package. (`pdf <pkg/terraPackage.pdf>`__)
  | 



.. topic:: II. `Geographic Information Analysis <rosu/index.html>`__ 

   | R companion to Geographic Information Analysis by O'Sullivan and Unwin. (`pdf <rosu/ROSU.pdf>`__)
   |


This is the "terra" version of this resource. You can also go to the now outdated `"raster/sp" <https://rspatial.org/raster/index.html>`_ version.
